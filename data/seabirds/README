This file contains Newick format source trees for the seabirds dataset; 
it is suitably formatted to be used as input to SuperFine:

seabirds/source trees/kennedy.source_trees_manual

======================================================================

These are the data files for the seabird dataset acquired from the original
study's authors:

seabirds/original data files/A96fig_withnames.tre
seabirds/original data files/B98fig_withnames.tre
seabirds/original data files/H98fig_withnames.tre
seabirds/original data files/I85fig_withnames.tre
seabirds/original data files/N98fig_withnames.tre
seabirds/original data files/P95fig_withnames.tre
seabirds/original data files/S90fig_withnames.tre

======================================================================

These two files are Python scripts which were used to transform the
original data files into the single source tree file.  The 
"cleanKennedy.py" script combines Newick trees from the original data files 
into a single file; the "recleanKennedy.py" script reads the resulting file 
and removes taxa as described in the SOM.
